hi! you can call me mweep, or pigeon ^^ I'm a birb/derg thing, and I use
they/them pronouns

things I might post about:

- magic the gathering, a *lot*. I think about magic too much, probably. Also
other card games!
- furry stuff, probably
- cyber/infosec/hacker stuff for fun and profit
- I like reading, especially sci fi/fantasy stuff. might start talking about
what books I'm reading
- I'm a big stationary nerd, and have a huge pile of fountain pens, inks, and
wax sealing stuff I love to play with. haven't had a chance to use them as much
lately, but you might see some of that. I don't buy as much new stuff as
I used to though, I'm happy with my pens - though there's always room for more
inks
- I also like fanfic! I don't read as much as I used to and I don't write
nearly at all anymore, but I may occasionally talk about that
- whatever my current video game fixation is, tends to be strategy game kinda
  stuff
- public transit is also a mild-to-extreme interest depending on the mood

I post a lot of bad decks - I'd consider myself primarily a limited junkie,
but I've been enjoying Standard a lot, and dabble in other formats as well. I
do like brewing EDH, though I don't find myself playing it very much these days
