### 1. [Casual Chat | Crapshots E782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAldLejDjeY)

A short (~1m) comedy skit by LoadingReadyRun (Canadian comedy/streamer/video group, does a lot of great Magic content among other things). Super tight writing, smooth delivery, and overall a great distillation of what I love about LRR's humor. Probably one of my new favorite Crapshots

### 2. [Star of the County Down - The Longest Johns ft. Colm McGuinness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7KeQzhfOQE)

Two of my favorite artists doing a real fun collab! Absolutely love the fact that Colm just walks off mid-song to grab a beer and jump right back in.
