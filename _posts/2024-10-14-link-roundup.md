### 1. [Casual Chat | Crapshots E782](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAldLejDjeY)

A short (~1m) comedy skit by LoadingReadyRun (Canadian comedy/streamer/video group, does a lot of great Magic content among other things). Super tight writing, smooth delivery, and overall a great distillation of what I love about LRR's humor. Probably one of my new favorite Crapshots

### 2. [Star of the County Down - The Longest Johns ft. Colm McGuinness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7KeQzhfOQE)

Two of my favorite artists doing a real fun collab! Absolutely love the fact that Colm just walks off mid-song to grab a beer and jump right back in.

### 3. [Citizen Sleeper 2 Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3198860/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector__Hexport_Demo/)

The original game is one of my fav "CRPGs" (whatever that genre even means), very well written and some clever tying of mechanics to theme/story. Not perfect, but something I really deeply enjoyed. This demo is pretty short, runs through a few cycles and a single contract, but I'm already enjoying the texture of the game, and it feels as if it has the potential to be a lot more expansive and replayable. Check it out!

That's all I've got for this set, not much, but I wanted to fire it off before I left. Been busy planning things to do for my Sydney trip (going to see the boyfriend! uvu), and also wrapping up stuff at work in preparation for the time off, so I haven't had as much time online.

In other things I'm doing: re-reading Annihilation in preparation for Absolution to release later this month, continuing to obsess over UFO 50, and being very excited for the upcoming panels on Magic at NYCC and MagicCon Vegas.
