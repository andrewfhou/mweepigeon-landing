> There’s an eyewitness we need to interview, and we’ve been running around in circles trying to find him. His name is Fblthp. Do a grid search for him within the art of five different Murders at Karlov Manor cards. Each time you find him, block off his position within the grid on this page.

> Once you’ve found all his hiding spots, draw a single loop in the grid below that doesn’t cross itself. The loop passes through every cell that doesn’t contain Fblthp, but none of the cells that do. In each cell, the path must either go straight or make a 90-degree turn.

Pretty straightforward puzzle to solve, most of the work is figuring out which cards Fblthp is on. Prior to this puzzle's release, the community had collectively identified 3 of those cards, though his appearance was thought to be an easter egg rather than an explicit puzzle

The cards with Fblthp are: They Went That Way, Repulsive Mutation, Crime Novelist, Karlov Watchdog, and Offender at Large

Summing it all up as instructed, we have that the solution is DGM 102 - Showstopper. The corresponding MKM card is (though the mask isn't exactly the same)
