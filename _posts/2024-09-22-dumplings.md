![chili oil dumplings](chili-oil-dumplings.jpg)

they're a super easy, super convenient meal. Boil some frozen dumplings, toss it over your sauce, and call it a day.

I haven't actually done this in a lazy meal in awhile, but I had picked up a few bags of frozen dumplings from 99 ranch and was just so tired after I got home on Friday that I decided to cook them, and while grabbing stuff for a dipping sauce I remembered that this was a thing I could do (and had done a lot of in college)

I used frozen ones but you can make your own dumplings and freeze them too! In fact, this sort of stream-of-consciousness post is half a reminder to myself to go by some napa cabbage so I can make dumplings next weekend

Anyways, to have some actual content - here's how to make a similar sauce and (roughly) the recipe I use for dumplings

## 水饺 dumplings (pork & cabbage)
### ingredients
- ~1 lb ground pork
- ~1 lb napa cabbage (minced)
- 3/4 cups water 
- soy sauce to taste (1 tbsp)
- sesame oil to taste (1 tbsp)
- ~1.5 tablespoons corn starch
- ~1/2 tsp salt (for pork)
- prepared dumpling skins, ~1 lb
### process
- add salt to cabbage and wait, squeeze out water
- add water, soy sauce, sesame oil, corn starch, salt to ground pork, mix
- combine cabbage and pork mixture - this is your filling
- test salinity of filling by dropping a bit into boiling water
- wrap dumplings
- drop into boiling water, remove when fully cooked (floating)
	- you can add a cup of cold water when it starts boiling so the hard boil doesn't break the skin. I usually don't bother

## chili oil dumplings sauce
gonna be real I don't *really* have a recipe for this insofar as ratios, it's just a list of ingredients you can mix together and pour over a bowl of dumplings.
- chinese black vinegar
- soy sauce
	- either dark or light soy sauce is fine. if using light, add some brown sugar - the sweetness contrasts the vinegar nicely. if using dark, you may want to add some salt to taste
	- worcestershire sauce can work nicely here too (also makes an excellent dipping sauce for potstickers)
- chili oil
	- I use homemade 油泼辣子, but you can use whatever you enjoy. I would lean away from 'chili crisp' though, or try to just use the oil from a jar
	- I also use a few dashes of a sichuan chili oil (fly by jing's sichuan gold from a hot ones box). If I didn't have this I'd probably do some ground toasted sichuan peppercorns (optionally grind and pour hot oil on top to release the flavors)
- minced garlic
- bit of sesame oil
- garnish with cilantro and sesame seeds

Also, if you want to just do a simple dipping sauce, do soy sauce/vinegar/water in a 1:2:1 ratio and garnish with cilantro and sesame seeds. Serve with a separate dish of chili oil so people can mix to their own preferences. 

anyways, that's all from me. thanks for reading!
