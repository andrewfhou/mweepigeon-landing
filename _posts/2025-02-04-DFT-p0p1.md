Aetherdrift is definitely a funky set, between the tensions of the Speed mechanic and the Vehicle/Mount Density

<details>
<summary>My Picks:</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>W: <strong>Ride's End</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>I refuse to underestimate this removal spell again I swear to god</p>
<ul>
<li>U: <strong>Gearseeker Serpent</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Definitely a bit of a buildaround, but I don't think you have to build around all that hard for this to be good</p>
<ul>
<li>B: <strong>Pactdoll Terror</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Speed trigger enabler and potential win condition</p>
<ul>
<li>R: <strong>Burner Rocket</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Feels like a really good combat trick that also leaves behind a respectable body</p>
<ul>
<li>G: <strong>Run Over</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Trying not to underrate removal so often and this seems like a strong one. I just like Bite Down, and I <i>really</i> like Bite Down for a single mana</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 1: <strong>Lightning Strike</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Premium removal that can sometimes kill your opponent - extra relevant if you need just one more speed trigger too</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 2: <strong>Grim Bauble</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Disfigure/Stab is great - this isn't instant speed, but it <i>is</i> an artifact with some additional upside, so I'll happily take it</p>
<ul>
<li>2CUDS: <strong>Lagorin, Soul of Alacria</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Cheap flier that's easy to saddle and has massive upside when you do so. You do want a density of Mounts and Vehicles to target, but since it can target itself for one of the counters this starts growing pretty quick even in isolation</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiebreaker: <strong>Agonasaur Rex</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>A really potent modal card - while 5 mana 8/8 trample does die to murder, it also kills your opponent. And an uncounterable +2/+2 trample indestructible trick for 3 mana? That's the shit</p>
</p>
