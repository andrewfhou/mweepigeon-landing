This post contains some of my notes on the lore, worldbuilding, and story of Magic's [Edge of Eternities](https://magic.wizards.com/en/story), though it will not be comprehensive. I usually also post my speculation on the r/magicTCG subreddit in the story discussion threads, but this will contain more general stuff, things like terminology and structure, as opposed to live-theorizing after each episodes. Naturally, this post will include spoilers for the story and Planeswalker's Guide, but **does not contain information from leaks**.

This post was last updated with the release of Episode 11, the final episode, of the Main Story (2025-07-07)

## Social Media Audio Clips

Magic has been posting some audio clips on social media that I initially ignored, but they actually have text that is not present in the main story, and some of it is quite interesting.

### Transcripts

[episode 1](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3ls2zxylrcu2b>), narrated by Sami.

> This is Captain Sami of the Seriema, making our approach towards Sigma's Reach. We were told there would be a mining colony here to greet us, but it looks... deserted. Investigating further.

[episode 2](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lseeemu4uc2x>), narrated by Tannuk

> Captain. I'm getting reports of strange readings deeper in the quarry. I'd try to convince you not to investigate, but I know better by now. Just, stay safe.

[episode 3](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lsgutkgcrn2s>), unknown narrator, possibly Alpharael

> The blessed Faller guides my hand. I have glimpsed the edge of the void, felt its pull, and will show others the beauty of INEVITA. This is the way of the Monoists.

[episode 4](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lsjfciajv22k>), narrated by unknown Summist knight at the breach point.

> This is an urgent call for my fellow Summists. The *Dawnsire* is under attack. We've been placed in a tactical event horizon, requesting immediate assistance. The *Dawnsire* mustn't fall. For the Sum!

[episode 5](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lslvrfxlz526>), narrated by Sami

> Hey... Tannuk, you seeing this? There's a Hopelight craft on the scanners but... get this. There's other Summist ships firing on it. Whatever's going on there has to be pretty dangerous. And profitable. Let's check it out

[episode 6](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lsth65itzv2m>), based on the ep2 clip this sounds like it's also narrated by Tannuk. 

> I felt something change... on the ship. I saw the Monoist boy tearing apart those Kav, saw this power flow through him, like nothing I've ever seen. And then it... un-happened. Whatever that was, I don't trust it

[episode 7](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lsvxn4r6js2d>), unknown narrator (male sounding voice)

> Syr Vondam's condition seems to have worsened. He calls himself "anstruth," rambling about a death that was stolen from him. There's only one thing that will satiate him. Capturing Alpharael

[episode 8](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lsyi42g3pi2s>), likely narrated by Syr Vondam

> Solar knights. Down there. That cursed artifact lessens everything it touches. It seeks to lessen the Sum, to bring the Monoist goals ever closer to completion. Charge nuncio emitters, recall our knights. Then do it. Initiate Protocol Seven.

[episode 9](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lt2ykwcfpy2x>), narrated by Tezzeret

> I must admit, the captain and their crew have surpassed my expectations. If this Stone is everything Mm'menon claims it to be, this is my chance to claim the power I rightfully deserve.

[episode 10](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lt5izumh2w2u>), narrated by Sami

> To all of Pinnacle stationed at Infinite Guideline: we're coming in hot with a very dangerous payload. We're asking for passage through the Eternity Column. And as you can tell by the two armies tailing us, we don't have time for deliberation.

[episode 11](<https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3ltf2gnrdvw2m>), narrated by Tezzeret

> The Eldrazi. All the way out here? These mockeries of logic continue to vex me. No matter. Once I reach the eternity column, I'll begin my apotheosis. Power. Uncontrolled power, will finally be mine

### Notes on Audio Clips

Most of these are just a bit of extra fluff, a teaser to the plot of the episode, but some are fairly significant. Episode 1's clip is most notable, as it reveals that as Sami and Tan approached Sigma's Reach, they were told that there was a mining colony and people there. However, in Episode 1's story, by the time the two are descending into atmosphere they already believe the colony to be unpopulated

> "There wasn't supposed to be anyone here," Sami mutters. "They built a colony to mine the clay, but the sun was going to explode. **So no one ever came.**"

So the implication is maybe that in Revision 6, the colonists existed, but by Revision 10 they had been erased. This further supports the possibility that Revisions 7-9 involved the Anathalmanac and the colonists being erased by the artifact.

Episode 6's clip also implies that Tan might have some limited memory of the previous revisions. This is also suggested in Episode 5, where Tan seems to have some alternate memory of the inspection cyst in Sigma's Reach.

> "Where you found me back on Sigma? After I passed out. Big soft sack."
> Tannuk stares at Sami with an indecipherable Kav expression. "Oh. Passed out, yeah. In the big soft sack."
> "Tan, are you … okay?"

Sami remembers passing out in the cyst, but they also see Tan carrying a body that the story implies might be Sami's and putting them into the pool in the cyst, where the divergences collapse and Sami passes out. Interestingly, there is no new revision here.

## Main Story Revisions

The story introduces us to these 'revisions' and the CYOA format in episode 1, but in such a way that is easy to overlook or dismiss as set dressing. Similarly with the narrator speaking to the reader and asking them to make choices. However, as we've progressed and learned more about this artifact that Sami and Tan have, they in fact appear to be different branches of reality created by the artifact, forcing the reader to choose and resetting when we choose 'wrong'

Also, it is notable that the Anathalmanac outlined in Episode 1 seems to be a Summist manual on how to handle the artifact, and the methods it instructs one to follow are fully deterministic. Based on things like birth date or measured velocity vectors or closest distance. This, alongside the description in episode 5

> There are many ways to get to one place. I cannot change that place. But I can change the way it was arrived at.
> I need a wielder who offers me a library of moments to alter. I need a moment vulnerable to influence.
> Complexity stymies me. The nature of the universe compels me to self-consistency. I cannot leave loose ends. All my alterations must be explained: by chance, if nothing else avails.

suggests that the artifact can alter reality, but only within a degree of plausibility. It must have have an opportunity of choice or chance for it to act, and by acting deterministically, the Summists attempt to deny it those opportunities

Here, I outline the numbered revisions and what seems to have been the impetus for their creation

### Revision List

- **Revision 0:** The narrator doesn't find an agent, and shatters when the sun explodes (goes nova?)
- **Revision 1:** The narrator finds us and asks us to choose someone to find it.
	- We choose not to
- **Revision 2:** We choose yes. We hear about the history of Sothera, but it's unknown how this revision ends or what choice we are asked to make.
- **Revision 3:** ???
- **Revision 4:** Impetus for this revision unknown. The narrator asks us to make Mm'menon's life interesting.
	- Us refusing leads to its capture by the Drix
- **Revision 5:** We make Mm'menon's life interesting, causing his exile. The narrator asks us to prevent the Metalman from finding it, depriving him of certain specialists and resources.
	- Us refusing leads to its capture by the Metalman
- **Revision 6:** We prevent the Metalman from finding the narrator. We're told the setup to Sami's search for Mirri.
- **Revision 7-9:** Unknown. This section is replaced by the Anathalmanac, and episode 1 then jumps straight to...
- **Revision 10:** We open on Sami and Tan traveling to Sigma's Reach, and it's noted that the colony is unpopulated. The main story continues on this revision for several episodes until the attack. Alpharael throws away his singularity bead and the narrator asks us to grant him mercy, to prevent him from being killed.
	- Us refusing leads to Alph's death and the narrator being found by the Drix (and we also get a rant about its true masters)
- **Revision 11:** We choose to grant mercy to Alpharael, presumably leading to his capture and Slats allowing his escape on the Hopelight. Once again this continues steady for a bit until Alpharael gets the artifact in episode 5 and starts ranting about INEVITA.
	- The narrator asks us to give Alpharael a hand and allow it to perform a miracle. Here, we aren't given a choice, and jump to
- **Revision 12:** the beginning of Episode 6, *giving Alpharael a hand* (heh) by letting it not be blown off by the singularity bead, and changing pretty significantly what happened as Sami and Tan approached Kavaron
- **Revision 13:** This revision seems to be Alpharael's impetus instead of ours (or, are we Alpharael?) He opens the stasis cask, retrieves the stone, and we flash to Revision 13 with Sami and Tan trying to make their way back to the *Seriema*. We don't know exactly what has changed in this revision, but it has made the pair lucky, made it easier for them to get back and hiding them from view of the Sunstar knights. Tan seems to have some knowledge of how bad it was before.
	- At the fork point of this revision, Haliya shoots Sami and Tan before Alph hits her with the jet injector and we see the stone glow pink
- **Revision 14**. The paralytic agent in the jet injector stops Haliya before she can shoot Sami and Tan, allowing them to return to the ship safely and eventually escape Kavaron. Perhaps it also plays on Syr Vondam's fondness for Haliya, resulting in an incomplete enaction of Protocol Seven.
	- Tezzeret drops a crystal over a map of Sothera, asking the narrator to show him where it needs to go. We can choose to drop it over other places other than the narrator's desired destination, resulting in various outcomes the narrator does not stand, and forces us to choose again.
	- If we choose to drop it onto the Wurmwall, the narrator questions if we are cheating, and makes some interesting notes about how we will travel there eventually, but not "in the tedious substrate of secular space". Either way, it is still wrong, and we revert.
- **Revision 15**. We guide the crystal to land on the Uthros libratory point, to Infinite Guideline, and so the crew proceeds that way. To infinity, and beyond.
- **Revision 16**. The final revision, at least in our story. Likely used for Alph to guess the warp ferry codes, though he doesn't have the Endstone at the moment, since he will hold it in the future

## Vocab

This is a list of some of the vocabulary used in the story that I've broken down for both meaning and etymology

- **Alabile**. A singularity-resistant metal. used by monoists for armor. able to defer/delete attacks upon it, releasing them when too damaged to store
	- => alabaster? ablative? a-labile (not liable [to change])?
- **Armor fati**. Fate's Armorer
	- => A play on the latin "amor fati", meaning "love of fate"; instead implying "armor of fate"
- **Anstruth**. Blasphemy
	- => Anathematic truth, anathematic reality. Falsehood, reality warped by the artifact
- **Bladiator**. Hardlight blade that can emit blasts of energy
	- => blade radiator 
- **Checkmate**. Pinnacle position paired with Director, combining first officer with adversarial counselor
	- => Check as in check-and-balance; Mate as in assistant/first officer.
- **Cherazad Generator**. A means of deferring momentum from impact
	- => sheherazade / shahrazad, from One Thousand and One Nights. Staving off death temporarily
- **Coach** and **Postilion**. Archetypical twin authority positions in Kav contrimperial Teamer culture. The coach drives, the postilion navigates
	- => Postilion is derived from French and Italian, and originally meant the guide/forerunner for the post (mail). It now means the person who rides a horse pulling a coach or carriage in lieu of a coachman in order to guide it.
	- => Similarly, coach is likely derived from coach (carriage). These terms are a straightforward lift.
	- These terms seem related to **Teamer**. A pre-Break anti-authority Kav culture or organizational structure?
		- => likely derived from teamster, the one who drives pack animals pulling a card
		- => Seems also to have some relation, in terms of solidarity, with the Teamsters (union)
- **Contrimperial**. ???
	- => Contra-imperial? So, against the Kavaronic Federal Empire, anti-authority?
- **Cyndomine**. A Summist mine.
	- => from cynidocyte, a stinging cell in jellyfish. a miniature anti-armor mine
- **Eld**. An old being/thing. An Eldrazi
	- => truncation of Eldrazi
- **Eikonostasis**. Patterned light (data)
	- => iconostasis, a wall of icons separating the nave (central portion) from the sanctuary.
- (Squadron) **Hawking/Beckon-Hawk radiation**
	- => it's Hawking radiation, or Bekenstein-Hawking radiation. Entangled particles, one of which enters the black hole and the other escaping
- **Himsary** (banner). knightly oaths
	- => hymn rosary? described as a 'reticulum', a net or network
- **Incaglas**. Used for data?
	- => incandescent glass => fiber optics
- **Kamu-shiku**. A Monoist suicide commando
	- => Some googling leads me to shiku (JP, 死苦) meaning death, bitterness; painful death. If we hold with Japanese, kamu leads to "bite", which perhaps fits okay? Shiku is the strongest part of this. Likely also meant to evoke "kamikaze"
	- => Kamu is also a pronoun, "you", in Indonesian, but I couldn't find anything for shiku there
- **Libratory point**. A point of balance between gravitational pulls. A Lagrange point
	- => libratory, from "libra" (balance). Meaning "oscillatory"
- **Lide**. Used in both "Lide, she's biting her tongue" and "We lide ... I lide it so, just now", 
	- as a verb for the astelli future sight?
	- analagous to 'lord' or some other invocation, or maybe "[I see/See], she's biting her tongue"?
	- => LIDAR, light detection? both a noun and verb?
- **Lidar**. Summist knight perception mechanism, using grids of light
	- => literally, LIDAR, LIght Detection And Ranging. 
- **Luxatic**. Monoist (?) insult against Summists. Lunatic.
	- => lux + lunatic
- **Markup rag**. A flexible sheet of writeable memory that can make itself rigid for use. A tablet
	- => A rag that you can mark up. No fancy etymology here
- **Miracho**. a monoist frontline militant. untrained/unspecialized infantry? "a deleter, an eraser, a killer"
	- => unknown derivation
- **Phorocast**. Astelli divination method
	- => light forecast. divination through the quantum (?) nature of light
- **Photophoroi**. a class (?) of soldier or knight?
	- => phoros, one who bears/brings; light-bringers
- **Sekhar**. A bead that induces a singularity
	- => chandrasekhar limit (maximum mass of a stable white dwarf) 
- **Sput**. insult?
	- => sput[tering light]
- **Subedar**. KMN field soldier experienced in handling offworlders
	- => [a South Asian military rank, roughly equivalent to warrant officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subedar)
	- **Jemadar**. Lower rank of the same role
		- => [ranked below a Subedar in the same system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemadar)
- **Qalib**. A Drix song, or title, or class?
  - => From the Arabic "qalib"/”qalb", meaning form or model or template? Heart, the center of human philosophy per Islamic philosophy?
- **Susur Secundi**. the planet closest to sothera, and claimed by the monoists
	- => susur from susurrous (a hum/a whisper)
	- => second whisper (after the monoist capital, the Lip of Susur. literally, the second in importance)
	- **Susurians**. the species that founded monoism
		- => whisperers
- **Synodic sobor**. a temple to the star
	- => [Synodic—relating to stars] [Sobor—synod/assembly (Russian)]. Star/sun assembly. apropos for the bridge of a Summist ship 
- **Tidal claws**. component of monoist alabile armor. allows for generating gravitational pull
	- => tidal forces/acceleration

## [Planeswalker's Guide to EOE](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/planeswalkers-guide-to-edge-of-eternities)

These are the notes I took as I read the Planeswalker's Guide to try and get a better grasp on things. I've gone back and edited a bit as the story has progressed, but have not done so extensively, so you should treat the below as capturing my thoughts at the time rather than as an up-to-date reference.

### Science/Tech
- **"Chaos Wall"** (or rather, the universe behind it): the "known" Magic Multiverse, high chaos/entropy
	- The implication seems to be that the "Chaos Wall" itself is what we know of as the Blind Eternities, so the known multiverse and Edge are accessing it from different sides? 
	- the Edge observes blueshift towards the Chaos Wall and redshift towards the Quiet Wall; the Guide notes that this is an implication of expansion. So we have a toroidal universe in the midst of expansion, similar to our own
		- Odd note: the Garden of Apeiron, a sort of Bermuda Triangle esque region of space in the Sothera system, has been recently crawling from deep space towards Sothera "at a rate faster than normal gravitic drift"
		- Update: upon further consideration, given the fact that the universe is described as "ring-like and toroid. In a word, annular", and the fact that we have two distinguishable boundaries (the Chaos and Quiet walls respectively), I believe the shape of the Edge is that of an "annular toroid", or a set of two nested toroids. The outer toroid being the Edge and the inner toroid being the known Multiverse, with the boundary against the  inner toroid being the Chaos Wall and the outer boundary being the Quiet Wall
			- Because of the two distinct boundaries, it can't just be that the Edge is a single toroid and the universe is the "donut hole" in the middle, since there's no meaningful way to distinguish between the boundary of space near the donut hole or away from it, they're both simply one continuous boundary. I believe, then, that "annular" is used to describe the cross section, leading to the nested toroid theory
- **"Quiet Wall"**: heat death (low entropy). The domain of the Eldrazi? Or simply fading into nothingness?
	- Likely just the fade into nothingness due to expansion
- **FTL/"Weft"-travel**: involves dipping into the membrane of the Chaos Wall (the "Eternities" or "Weft") and shortly exiting at the destination.
	- Sounds similar to how Planeswalkers teleport between points on the same plane, effectively walking half-off into the Blind Eternities before re-walking to the current plane. May in fact be the same process, skimming across the Eternities, but entering and exiting on a different 'side' of it
	- Non-Drix must be use an Eternity Column to catapult themselves into the weft, into higher (?) lamella for travel. They also serve as beacons for vessels in the weft, but an Eternity Drive is sufficient to sink back into the lower lamella that is their reality—one doesn't need to arrive exactly at a Column
	- Redward/Blueward are directions or dimensions used weftwalking. Ships entering the warp are mentioned to travel both blueward and redward, so it might depend on where you are going? If we consider redshift/blueshift terminology, it might mean redwards is to higher lamella and bluewards is to lower, which fits with the first quote
		- "Plunges down and to the blue: a direction Sami recognizes only from the motion of ships entering warp."
		- "entangling with the column's wedge of laminar topology, and riding it redways into warp."
		- "The Seriema falls redward into warp."
- **Aether and Mana**: interestingly, called out explicitly as fundamental particles/substrates next to photons and quarks. This is the same understanding that Saheeli (and presumably Avishkari scientists) have - that mana and aether are fundamental elements and subject to their respective conservation laws. We also know from previous lore that aether is some form of energy relating to the Blind Eternities.

### Individuals
- **Mm'menon**: an Illvoi (jellyfish) formerly of the Ulthros Combine (now exiled), Tezzeret's contact and informant on the Edge. Is the one providing the information in this Guide to Tezzeret.
- **Tezzeret**: "The Metalman". Attempting to retrieve an unknown artifact (the narrator of episode 1) and the one who recruited Sami and Tan to go ransack a ghost colony

### Organizations
- **Pinnacle**: the primary coalition entity utilizing what sounds like a complex barter and reputational economy. Operates the FTL network (or, specifically, the eternity columns which serve as the waypoints for it.) Notably, not all systems are members of Pinnacle, including the native Sotheran species.
	- split into the Strategic Corps (administration; soft power roles) and Tactical Corps (all the other day-to-day work. Presumably this also consists of their military force, which Tezz hints at)
- **The Drix**: a species with the ability to weftwalk, predating Pinnacle, and the ones who provided FTL tech to Pinnacle. Developed from an ancient artifact called "the Fabric of All Being" that predates the Fomori-Eldrazi conflict 
	- **Beam worlds**: "anchor" worlds. Naturally occuring eternity columns?
		- This is beam as in the beam of a *loom* that touches all of the warp (vertical threads). Weftwalking is then traveling laterally along the loom beam, or the weft of this tapestry
		- Then, is "the Fabric of All Being" a representative map of the tapestry that is the Edge, or the Multiverse?
	- **Seam rippers**: Assistive technology that anchors a weftwalking Drix to their "home reality". It's unclear exactly what this means
	- **The Fomori-Eldrazi conflict**: I mean, this is the big one obviously, and Tezz evidently shares our enthusiasm. The Drix are Eldrazi hunters, aiming to prevent their return. It's probably unsurprising that the Fomori, a civilization with some degree of manipulation over the planes and navigating them, came into conflict with the Eldrazi (unconfirmed but often theorized to be the 'garbage collector' automata of the multiverse), though about what exactly I'm excited to find out. Presumably not malice but function, trying to reclaim some developed plane for reprocessing, but we shall see. Cleanly gets Eldrazi back into the playing field for this or future storylines
- **Monoism** (and the Monasteriat): one of the primary faiths and factions in EOE's story. As Tezz succinctly puts it, an "entropic death cult".
	- mentioned [on bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3ls2tpibu5q2i) (and implied at in ep 1 of the story) as clashing with the Solar Knights of the Sunstar Freecompany, with this being a major conflict of the Sothera system and EOE
- **Summism** (and The Celestial Palatinate): another faith, opposite Monoism. Some kind of holy empire with a hot mess of titles and obligations (both civic *and* church, yippee).
	- **The Sunstar Free Company**: a 'favored' regiment of the Regent Maximum (the leader of the Palatinate), the de facto state army of the Palatinate, and a mercenary group (though one that fights for cause, not coin)
	- **The Astelli**: Living mana and the remains of stars collapsed into supervoids. Opposed to the Monoists. The foundations of the current Summist faith (though this is a closely guarded secret). Have shared memories of the parent star that birthed them.

### Local Species/Organization
- **The Kavaronic Federal Empire**: Kavu-people native to Kavaron, forced to evacuate into orbital civilization due to the collapse of the planet.
	- Kav Memorial Navy: the empire's interstellar navy, consisting of primarily converted mining vessels. Hardier, but less maneuverable, than other fleets
- **Evendo-Strain Emuidians**: the Emuidians (bug-people) emerging from the seed brood left on Evendo, since hatched and in the process of terraforming Evendo. Communal beings, with an emphasis on brood consensus, but *not* a hive-mind.
- **The Uthros Combine**: a private research group and the typical home to Illvoi (jellyfish-people) in the Sothera system. Divided into Administration, R&D, and Security. Have a secret lab beneath the atmosphere of Uthros.

### Locations
- **Sothera**: the name of the supervoid (and former sun) that was the center of the Sothera system, and the setting of EOE. Was foretold to collapse into a supernova, but Monoists forced it into a supervoid instead using "sekhar" (a bead that causes singularity induction). The Thousandth supervoid
	- Sothera - Susur Secundi - Kavaron & Evendo - Adagia - Uthros
- **Susur Secundi (once Anuki)**. First from Sothera: Black aligned. Crisscrossed by labyrinths and claimed by the Monoists.
	- ["Susur Secundi, Void Altar"](https://i.imgur.com/oXrew71.jpeg)
- **Kavaron**. Twin-second from Sothera: Red aligned. Kav (kavu) homeworld. Was strip mined to the point of crumbling, with one portion ("Kavaron Before") tectonically stabilized and preserved/used as a sort of history museum, and the remainder ("Kavaron That Is") being cataclysmic landscape that attracts scavengers and hunters. 
	- ["Kavaron, Memorial World"](https://i.imgur.com/brly1SP.jpeg)
- **Evendo**. Twin-second from Sothera: Green aligned. Originally icebound but with a dormant Eumidian vanguard, the Kavaron cataclysms triggered their awakening and the planet has since been terraformed by the Eumidian. It now sports vibrant life in an equatorial band from which the glacial ice slowly melts. Some in the Kavaronic Empire eye it for conquest.
	- ["Evendo, Waking Haven"](https://i.imgur.com/PGFaaDC.jpeg)
- **Adagia (once Adawa)**. Third from Sothera: White aligned. Primary location for the Sunstar Free Company's operations. Scoured by constant winds with a thin and cold atmosphere.
	- ["Adagia, Windswept Bastion"](https://i.imgur.com/LtnPlUu.jpeg)
- **Uthros**. Fourth from Sothera: Blue aligned. A gas giant with dozens of moons and a cloudscape home to many creatures in the upper layers of its atmosphere. The depths are caustic and brutal, and home to a secret Uthros Combine (the Sothera-local Illvoi organization) research complex for atmospheric engineering and other, unknown topics
	- ["Uthros, Titanic Godcore"](https://i.imgur.com/6ASvhn9.jpeg)
- **The Wurmwall**. The asteroid belt ringing the Sothera system. Treacherous and home to derelicts, asteroids, and greatwurms
	- The side story [Compact me to Zero](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/edge-of-eternities-compact-me-to-zero) implies that the Wurmwall may be home to a Vaar node, an entrance to their virtual space, the Hylderhigh. [Episode 9](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/edge-of-eternities-episode-9#IntoTheWurmwall) of the main story also hints at something in the Wurmwall relevant to the Endstone
