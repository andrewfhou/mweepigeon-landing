Not going to lie, I've been busy lately so the previews have just not quite seeped in. But prerelease is fast approaching so I gotta get *something* in, especially with having had pretty decent performance the past few sets (a very respectable 24th on TDM)

<summary>My Picks:</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>W: <strong>Weapons Vendor</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Always reasonably excited for a white creature that replaces itself, albeit 4 mana is a lot more than 2. The upside seems real though, with a fair amount of equipment I'm interested in playing. Other consideration here is <b>White Auracite</b> as the o-ring pick</p>
<ul>
<li>U: <strong>Dragoon's Wyvern</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>RECTANGLES BABY. Preening Champions is baaaack</p>
<ul>
<li>B: <strong>Hecteyes</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>I feel this type of card generally performs well, and we've got enough of a sacrifice theme going around here.</p>
<ul>
<li>R: <strong>Thunder Magic</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>What can I say, I love a modal Shock. <b>Suplex</b> is the other thing I'm interested in here</p>
<ul>
<li>G: <strong>Town Greeter</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>As I said, love a creature that draws a card, and the 2 life on finding a Town is not insignificant upside. The downside is, of course, that this can whiff (although we have the classic GB graveyard theme as always)</p>
<ul>
<li>colorless/land common<strong>Crossroads Village</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Strong fixing land with incidental town synergies. Always happy to see it </p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 1: <strong>Vayne's Treachery</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Gonna double down on removal, especially one that plays into the other black card I like.</p>
<ul>
<li>2CUDS: <strong><del>Cloud of Darkness</del> Garnet, Princess of Alexandria</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Always love a two-for-one! Other cards I like here is <b>Garnet</b> with sufficient Saga build around, getting extra triggers and turns out of your Saga creatures sounds great, and stacking a bunch of counters on a lifelink body sounds fantastic. The only worry is that she's a bit vulnerable, but... yeah actually I just like Garnet more here.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tiebreaker: <strong>Jenova, Ancient Calamity</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>I think I just like black this set, but also the Luminarch Aspirant design has been consistently good and drawing cards off it sometimes is great. Of course, your opponent can just remove Jenova, but even so.</p>
