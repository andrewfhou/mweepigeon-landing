Figured I'd start doing one of these, since I've been seeing things here and there I want to share. I wouldn't count on this being all that well curated or even presented, it'll purely just be some shit I saw that was cool.

### 1. [UFO 50 Soundtrack by Eirik Suhrke](https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/album/ufo-50)

On Bandcamp Friday no less!

I talked a little bit about UFO 50 back on cohost but never really expounded on it - basically, it's a collection of 50 retro-styled games presented as a curated catalog of a fictional company's games. There's some meta-narrative stuff and secrets to find, but mostly it's just 50 whole entire really good games, everything from action to strategy to JRPGs to an *idle game!* Of particular interest to me have been the games Jon Perry worked on - he does excellent board games, and you can absolutely see that influence here (Party House and Avianos are standouts for me)

Anyways - those 50 games also all have soundtracks, many with multiple tracks!!! And this album, for $7 USD, comes with all *331 tracks* in the game. Here are some highlights for me:

- ["Orb Shower" - Caramel Caramel](https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/track/caramel-caramel-orb-shower)
- ["Forest A" - Mooncat](https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/track/mooncat-forest-a) (all of Mooncat, tbh)
- ["Map" - Camouflage](https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/track/camouflage-map)
- ["Red" - Warptank](https://phlogiston.bandcamp.com/track/warptank-red)

But really, it's all incredible. Give it a listen!

### 2. [Weather Memoku (Puzzmo)](https://www.puzzmo.com/+/weather/play/weather-memoku)

A new experimental game on Puzzmo, which are normally subscriber only, but this one is "unlocked" for everyone on The Weather Channel's instance of Puzzmo. Oh, right, yeah - this was done in collaboration with The Weather Channel. Everyone wants games now!

It's like a memory game, except the icons follow sudoku rules. I don't even know if I like it? I can't tell if the emoji actually mean anything in relation to the forecast or if it's just fluff, and I'm not all that motivated to go for speed or min flips. I'll probably keep playing it for a bit but I can see myself falling off. Still, it's kind of a cool idea that I wanted to share

### 3. [Leah Gardner's Bird Art](https://leahgardner.art/collections/birds)

Leah Gardner is an oil painter who does, among other things, excellent paintings of birds - pigeons in particular

Today happens to be the last day for her BOGO 50% off sale on prints, but mostly I just want to make sure everyone sees [this beauty](https://leahgardner.art/products/laser-pigeon?variant=43416688427223) of a pidge.

### Other Things I'm Excited About (mostly books)
