So. Somebody gave me a very bad idea.

Honestly I've been in a bit of a crafting "rut" for awhile, haven't been able to find the motivation to work on a tail for my sona or anything else. For whatever reason this stupid conversation really grabbed my brain - so hey, why not? It'd be great to put my hands back to work. 

By the time I committed I had juuuuust enough time to run out to Joanns and Michaels for some supplies before they closed, plus a pit stop at the library to print off a dome head pattern.

I'm going for a kemono styled head, *definitely* kemono style eyes, though I'm not certain how exactly I want to approach his wide mouth - I think I'll probably sculpt that little muzzle bump he has like a kemono head's muzzle, but then additionally sculpt out the grin across the rest of the face out of what would typically be the cheek pieces, so there's no 'bump' on those parts. The teeth... well, we'll get there when we get there.

For now, all I've done is cut out the pieces for my head base and glue together half the dome ([using this pattern](http://freakhoundstudios.com/sphere)), I'll probably finish it out tomorrow evening - was originally planning to try and do the entire dome tonight, but I got distracted and it also just took me a bit to get back into the flow of things.
