Well, [cohost is shutting down](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down).

RIP, and long live eggbug.

The site will be going read-only on 2024-10-01 with attempts to keep the lights
on until the end of the year. To be honest, it's kind of crushing - I *really*
liked cohost, it felt cozy, it felt like home. Sure, I didn't have a large
community or following, but I saw maybe a half dozen faces consistently when
talking about magic, I got to have real conversations, and I got to do longform
writeups.

Speaking of, one of the largest motivations for getting this site up
and running is to have a place to host my MKM ARG writeups, which I'm still
very proud of. Hopefully that will be up soon, I had already saved all the
source as MD files, but I'll need to update all the links, and of course there
are dozens, maybe even over a hundred images I'll need to rehost with the
amount of conspiracy board shit I was up to.

For now, I've got this first post up and the basic information sorted out, and
I'll probably be working on uploading, editing, and backdating all the MKM ARG
posts over the next week or so. But it's nearly 1am and I *do* still have to
work tomorrow (though I'll probably take the morning remote), so I'll be
signing off for now.

Love y'all <3
