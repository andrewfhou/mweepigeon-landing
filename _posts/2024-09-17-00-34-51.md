I am working entirely with the GitJournal GUI for this one, I won't open the raw editor and I'll set the tags with the GUI as well. We'll see if it's well formatted enough that this shows up as a post on the blog. If so, fantastic!

edit: it worked! Kind of? The tag format is acceptable to Jekyll so that worked entirely out of box. If I wanted to set a "category" I'd have to do it manually though. Also, Jekyll is clearly deriving a date from the file name but that isn't being put into the front matter by GitJournal for some reason. Because of that, the two posts with the same date are showing up in the wrong order

But, honestly, this is a pretty reasonable setup with low amounts of "techy" interfacing required
