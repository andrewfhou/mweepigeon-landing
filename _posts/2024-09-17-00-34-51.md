tags: [jekyll, meta]
categories: null

I am working entirely with the GitJournal GUI for this one, I won't open the raw editor and I'll set the tags with the GUI as well. We'll see if it's well formatted enough that this shows up as a post on the blog. If so, fantastic!

edit: it worked! Kind of? The tag format is acceptable to Jekyll so that worked entirely out of box. If I wanted to set a "category" I'd have to do it manually though. Also, Jekyll is clearly deriving a date from the file name but that isn't being put into the front matter by GitJournal for some reason. Ah, well, good enough - I'd say it's pretty seamless
