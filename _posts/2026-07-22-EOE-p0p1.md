I've been slacking on set reviews lately (hard to wrangle the friend group and everyone, myself included, is just so busy) but I have to redeem my abysmal performance with FIN's p0p1 (after switching off my gut instinct last minute.) Besides, I'm super excited about this set

<details>
<summary>My Picks:</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>W: <strong>Knight Luminary</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Two 1/1s and a 3/2 all in one card is great, and at split costs of 2 and 4 I'm pretty into it. There's incentives for going wide too, and multiple creatures also enables greater flexibility with Station, which is probably good.</p>
<ul>
<li>U: <strong>Cryogen Relic</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Cryogen Relic obviously looks great in the artifact-sacrifice archetype, but with a very reasonable self sacrifice ability I think I'm pretty happy to run this in most of my blue decks, especially slower ones. Second pick here would probably be Mental Modulation, which is built for two-spells but has plenty of flexibility too</p>
<ul>
<li>B: <strong>Virus Beetle</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Disruptive two drop that either chumps or gets sacrificed later for extra value. What's not to like?</p>
<ul>
<li>R: <strong>Drill Too Deep</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Artifact removal, or instant-speed make your Spacecraft into a creature. There are certainly situations where this might be awkward, but I think it's flexible enough and that there are enough artifacts you want to destroy that I'm into it</p>
<ul>
<li>G: <strong>Biosynthetic Burst</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>I recall Gaea's Gift being quite solid in BRO. Biosynthetic Burst trades the hexproof for untapping the creature, which is both good and bad. Worse as a protection special against several pieces of exile removal, but lets you ambush opposing attacks very effectively.</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 1: <strong>Banishing Light</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>It's Banishing Light, how bad could it be? You do probably have to be careful not to hit something with a solid ETB (and warp as a mechanic seems to make it so there are mor of those) but it's probably fine</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 2: <strong>Gravkill</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>Going for removal again. Getting to exile the card is great, and 4 mana instant is a reasonable rate. Also getting to hit noncreature Spacecraft is a big boon, since some have strong static abilities that your opponent is incentivized to shield by not actually stationing it into a creature</p>
<ul>
<li>2CUDS: <strong>Syr Vondam, the Lucent</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>A potent curve topper for any go-wide strategy, but also a very reasonable statline on its own at 5 mana 4/4 deathtouch lifelink. The fact that this even has an ETB trigger feels bonkers, and +1/+0 and deathtoch makes it never profitable for your opponent to block, while pushing a significant amount of damage if they don't.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiebreaker: <strong>Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar</strong></li>
</ul>
	<p>I guess Syr Vondam is the star of the set, because his rare also looks incredibly good. A grow threat with great keywords that even trades for a card if your opponent doesn't remove it before he hits 4 power (and that's only 2 triggers!) The question is just if you can enable him yourself well enough, and from what I'm seeing of WB it seems not too hard to kill off a few of your creaturesâ€”or, better yet, your opponent's</p>
