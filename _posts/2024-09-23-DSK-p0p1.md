Honestly this is just gut feeling off cursory looks and 2 drafts and a sealed over prerelease weekend because I really did not have time/energy to think about it deeper. Haven't listened to any set review / limited content much less done my own review

<details>
<summary>My Picks:</summary>
<p>

- W: **Hardened Escort**

Disgusting in multiples

- U: **Unable to Scream**

I think this is just efficient removal with synergistic upside 

- B: **Innocuous Rat**

Seems very gluey. Could totally just be murder

- R: **Glassworks**

Is this better than Scorching Dragonfire? It probably isn't, but the upside feels kinda real to me. Plus I've been seeing them go late

- G: **Say Its Name**

Very gluey card that fuels delirium but is also just a Raise Dead effect, with a fairly achievable upside of tutoring Altanak (getting 3 copies is tricky when the base card is pretty good as-is though)

- bonus common 1: **Wary Watchdog**

I think this is just a really good 2 drop

- bonus common 2: **Most Valuable Slayer**

In the vein of Escort, a super annoying card that makes blocking hard and can help snowball your survival cards

- 2CUDS: **Broodspinner**

Total guess. Broodspinner has an overstatted body with reach (something that feels important and less common in the format) *and* has an ETB relevant to its archetype - and that's all on the face of it. You can cash it in later to instantly gum up the board, or just make enough creatures to close out the game

- Tiebreaker: **The Swarmweaver**

Yeah card seems like a nightmare and there are even other insects/spiders (like Broodspinner!!) in the format.
