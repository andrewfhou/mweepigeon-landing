Honestly this is just gut feeling off cursory looks and 2 drafts and a sealed over prerelease weekend because I really did not have time/energy to think about it deeper. Haven't listened to any set review / limited content much less done my own review

<details>
<summary>My Picks:</summary>
<p>
<ul>
<li>W: <strong>Hardened Escort</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Disgusting in multiples</p>
<ul>
<li>U: <strong>Unable to Scream</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is just efficient removal with synergistic upside </p>
<ul>
<li>B: <strong>Innocuous Rat</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Seems very gluey. Could totally just be murder</p>
<ul>
<li>R: <strong>Glassworks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this better than Scorching Dragonfire? It probably isn&#39;t, but the upside feels kinda real to me. Plus I&#39;ve been seeing them go late</p>
<ul>
<li>G: <strong>Say Its Name</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Very gluey card that fuels delirium but is also just a Raise Dead effect, with a fairly achievable upside of tutoring Altanak (getting 3 copies is tricky when the base card is pretty good as-is though)</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 1: <strong>Wary Watchdog</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is just a really good 2 drop</p>
<ul>
<li>bonus common 2: <strong>Most Valuable Slayer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the vein of Escort, a super annoying card that makes blocking hard and can help snowball your survival cards</p>
<ul>
<li>2CUDS: <strong>Broodspinner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Total guess. Broodspinner has an overstatted body with reach (something that feels important and less common in the format) <em>and</em> has an ETB relevant to its archetype - and that&#39;s all on the face of it. You can cash it in later to instantly gum up the board, or just make enough creatures to close out the game</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiebreaker: <strong>The Swarmweaver</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah card seems like a nightmare and there are even other insects/spiders (like Broodspinner!!) in the format.</p>
